## 🛡️ Welcome to my Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio where I'll document my journey specializing in **Blue Team** and **SOC operations**.

### Why Blue Team?

Proactive defense and threat detection fascinate me. I love the idea of:

- 🔍 **Threat Hunting**: Proactively searching for threats
- 📊 **Log Analysis**: Finding patterns and anomalies
- 🚨 **Incident Response**: Acting quickly during an attack
- 🛠️ **Automation**: Creating effective detections

### What will you find here?

In this blog I'll share:

1. **Practical projects** in security analysis
2. **Lab write-ups** (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc.)
3. **Malware analysis and attacker techniques**
4. **Tools and scripts** I'm developing
5. **Learning notes** about SIEM, forensics, etc.

### My Current Stack

```bash
# Tools I use regularly
├── SIEM: Splunk, Elastic Stack
├── Network: Wireshark, Zeek
├── Forensics: Volatility, FTK Imager
└── Automation: Python, PowerShell
```

**Stay tuned!** I'll start uploading more technical content soon 🚀
